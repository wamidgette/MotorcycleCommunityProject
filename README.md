# MotorcycleCommunityProject using ASP.NET & C#

## About
- This is a motorcycle group-trip community website where motorcycle riders can join trips with other riders. Each trip will have a list of the riders attending, the lead rider, and any events taking place on the trip
- At this point, CRUD functionality is only complete for Riders, and so trips and events associate are not yet displayed. However, this will be completed soon with the use of viewmodels
